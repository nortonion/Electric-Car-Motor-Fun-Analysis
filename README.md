# Electric-Car-Motor-Fun-Analysis

This dataset comes from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature
I do not intend to make this as a formal publication, but nevertheless, I would like to credit the LEA department at Paderborn University for allowing people to use their dataset. They have asked to cite these interesting sources below:
* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331982128_Deep_Residual_Convolutional_and_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_for_Temperature_Estimation_in_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Motors with the following code on their github: https://github.com/wkirgsn/deep-pmsm

* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331976678_Empirical_Evaluation_of_Exponentially_Weighted_Moving_Averages_for_Simple_Linear_Thermal_Modeling_of_Permanent_Magnet_Synchronous_Machines

This is my first time exploring a dataset with close to a million observations! It was an interesting experience trying out k-fold cross validation, as well as some exploratory data analysis using pandas profiling!
